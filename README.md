SimpleLineParser
================

Parser to deal with simple files that contain one item per line (and comments, and empty lines).
This is really a simple project, and something better probably exists.

Project Setup
=============

# Install Nuget command line (the second [Nuget][link])
# Clone the project and build project (which builds the tests too).
# (Optionally) Run the tests since the pre-build event will install the nuget packages into the solution.
The packages include NUnit and NUnitRunner.
# At this point LucidEdge.SimpleLineParser should be compiled.
